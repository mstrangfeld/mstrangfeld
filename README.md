Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marvin and Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at the RWTH Aachen University in Germany. I am interested in a variety of topics including: software engineering, DevOps and distributed systems but also things like physics, math, space exploration and music. I like the idea of Open Source and try to make as many projects publicly available as I can.
